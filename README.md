This is my django project that was created for the cyberclub.

This project was created for my practice.
I added redis to plug it in for the first time and minimize its use
also I could do other things like that for practice

I used boostrap for the basic frontend.

db: postgreSQL
cashe: redis
web-server: nginx

Thank you for reading
